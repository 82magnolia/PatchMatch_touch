# real_data_transfer

Scripts for capturing and processing data from physical sensors:
- **Intel RealSense D435i** — RGB-D camera
- **GelSight Mini** — tactile sensor

## Setup

> **Note:** Use a separate conda environment for real-world data collection. The main `pm_touch` env is reserved for running transfer and evaluation.

### 1. Create and activate the data-collection environment

```bash
conda create -n pm_real python=3.10
conda activate pm_real
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pyrealsense2
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install segment-anything         # SAM (Meta)
pip install opencv-contrib-python    # includes ARuCO support
pip install numpy open3d
```

> If you see a pyrealsense2 driver version mismatch at runtime, install the matching wheel explicitly:
> `pip install pyrealsense2==<version>` where `<version>` matches the output of `rs-enumerate-devices --version`.

### 3. Connect the RealSense D435i

Plug the camera into a **USB 3** port (blue tab). USB 2 ports will cause the depth stream to fail or produce degraded framerates.

Verify the camera is detected:

```bash
rs-enumerate-devices
```

You should see an entry like `Intel RealSense D435I` with a serial number.

## Scripts

### `visualize_realsense.py` — Real-time RGB-D viewer

Streams color and depth from the RealSense D435i and displays them in two windows:

| Window | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **RGB (left) \| Depth (right)** | cv2 window with color frame and JET-colorized depth side by side |
| **Point Cloud** | open3d window with interactive colored 3D point cloud |

**Run:**

```bash
python real_data_transfer/visualize_realsense.py
```

**Controls:**

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Left-drag (point cloud window) | Rotate |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom in / out |
| Right-drag | Pan |
| `q` (RGB-D window) | Quit |
| Close point cloud window | Quit |

---

### `calibrate_board.py` — One-time ARuCO board calibration

Establishes the 3D layout of all ARuCO markers on the turntable surface by observing them from multiple viewpoints and computing their positions relative to the lowest-ID (origin) marker.  Run this once per physical turntable setup; the result is used by `capture_turntable.py --board_config` for more accurate joint pose estimation.

**Run:**

```bash
python real_data_transfer/calibrate_board.py \
    --log_dir log/captures \
    --marker_size 0.035
# Saves log/captures/board_config.json
```

**Controls:**

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `c` | Capture current frame (accumulate detections) |
| `b` | Compute board layout from all accumulated frames and save |
| `q` | Quit |

**Tips:**
- Aim for 20+ frames.
- Vary the viewpoint by slightly tilting or shifting the camera (or rotating the turntable to different positions) so markers are seen from multiple angles.
- A good calibration prints `Z-spread < 5 mm`. Larger values mean more viewpoint diversity is needed.

### `capture_turntable.py` — Turntable capture with SAM + ARuCO pose tracking

Streams RGB-D with ARuCO marker axes overlaid. On each capture, the user clicks a point on the frozen frame to prompt SAM segmentation, then saves full and masked RGB/depth along with pose information.

#### SAM checkpoint

Download the ViT-B checkpoint (default) before first use:

```bash
# ViT-B (~375 MB, default)
wget -P log/ https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth

# ViT-L (~1.2 GB)
wget -P log/ https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth

# ViT-H (~2.4 GB, best quality)
wget -P log/ https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
```

**Run:**

```bash
# Default mode (per-marker independent poses):
python real_data_transfer/capture_turntable.py \
    --marker_size 0.035

# Board mode (recommended — joint pose, enforces coplanarity):
python real_data_transfer/capture_turntable.py \
    --board_config log/captures/board_config.json \
    --marker_size 0.035

# Saves to log/captures/ by default. Override with --log_dir log/my_session
# SAM defaults to log/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth (vit_b). Override with --sam_checkpoint / --sam_model_type
```

**Controls:**

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `c` (main window) | Freeze frame and enter capture mode |
| `q` (main window) | Quit |
| Drag left panel (capture mode) | Draw bounding box for SAM prompt |
| `Enter` (capture mode) | Run SAM inference |
| `r` (capture mode) | Redraw bounding box |
| `s` (capture mode) | Save capture |
| `Esc` (capture mode) | Cancel, return to live stream |

**Output** (per capture, zero-indexed):

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `NNN_rgb.png` | Full color frame |
| `NNN_depth.npy` | Raw depth (uint16, mm) |
| `NNN_depth_vis.png` | JET-colorized depth |
| `NNN_mask.png` | Binary SAM mask |
| `NNN_rgb_masked.png` | Color frame with mask applied |
| `NNN_depth_masked.npy` | Depth with mask applied |
| `poses.json` | ARuCO-derived poses for all captures |

**`poses.json` structure (per entry):**
- `marker_poses` — dict mapping each detected marker ID → 4×4 `T_marker_in_cam`
- `co_visible_marker_ids` — list of marker IDs visible in both this capture and pick 0; these are the markers used to compute `T_relative`
- `T_relative` — 4×4 transform relative to pick 0, averaged over all co-visible markers (SVD-re-orthogonalised mean R, mean t); `null` at pick 0 or when no co-visible markers exist

> **Note:** the more ARuCO markers remain co-visible across captures, the more robust the relative pose estimate. If no co-visible markers are found, a warning is printed and `T_relative` is `null`.
